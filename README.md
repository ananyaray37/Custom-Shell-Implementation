# Custom-Shell-Implementation
A custom shell implemented in C++ that executes user commands, manages processes, and supports input/output redirection, piping, and job control. Built using system calls such as fork, execvp, and waitpid, it demonstrates strong knowledge of Unix process management, system programming, and command-line interface design.
